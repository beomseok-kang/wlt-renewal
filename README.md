# Watch LCK Together Renewal

## About

Watch LCK Together is a toy project with full stack development done by [me](https://github.com/beomseok-kang). This is a SPA (Single Page App) that people can enter a team room and chat with the fans.

Unlike other chatting applications or streaming services, the chats appear on the screen (literally on the screen of youtube video), which I am expecting people to feel more like talking to each other.

The development is still on process.
